The original was: 
					complexarray = ((((Complex( 
							Signal.newFrom( magarray[0] ), 
							Signal.newFrom( magarray[1] ) 
					).magnitude.reverse)).log10) * 80).clip(0, 255); 

This resulted in magnitude values below 1 producing negative values after log10, which were then clipped away. 

***** Correction attempt (needs more testing after re setting fft buffer size to 1024)
      this clipped the higher frequencies away at fft buffer size 2048 or more, but the same was for the original algorithm

		 complexarray = (
			 (Complex(Signal.newFrom(magarray[0]), Signal.newFrom(magarray[1])).magnitude.reverse + 1).log10

***** DONE Introduce more color gradations and tweak the accessing of these

****** the intensity multiplier variable and the multiplication by 80 need to be tweaked.
****** The colors could be graded with a bias for low values as follows: 
       colors = (1..colorSize).pow(0.01).normalize.collect(blend(background, color, _));

***** Better solution (introduces _much_ more detail in low energy regions

Define vars in Spectrogram2: 

1. imageObjects: objects that draw on the image (before it is sent to pen)
1. penObjects: objects that draw with pen (after image is sent to pen) 

An object that wants to draw, must add itself to one of those two lists. 
Spectrogram2 will send all objects stored in imageObects the message drawImage, and all the objects stored in penObjects the image drawPen. 

An object can add itself to start drawing or remove itself to stop drawing. This is simpler than going via NotificationCenter.

**** function hashKey is taken from def.sourceCode, not def.code :uniquefunction:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ENTERED_ON: <2011-04-23 Sat 01:16>
     :END:

This is because, for example: 

{ WhiteNoise.ar(0.2) }
and
{ WhiteNoise.ar(0.1) }

have the same code: 

Int8Array[ 0, 0, 64, -80, -62, 52, -14 ]

So now, in order for a function to be treated as "unique" by UniqueFunction, it must have exactly the same source code string. 

Note: function.hashKey is used by UniquePlay.

**** Design of UniqueBuffer :uniquebuffer:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ENTERED_ON: <2011-04-23 Sat 20:28>
     :END:

***** Templates from existing classes to consider 
BUFFER:
	*new { arg server, numFrames, numChannels, bufnum;}
	*alloc(server, numFrames, numChannels, completionMessage, bufnum)
	*read { arg server, path, startFrame = 0, numFrames = -1, action, bufnum; }
	*read(server, path, startFrame, numFrames, action, bufnum)

UNIQUESYNTH:
	*new { | key, defName, args, target, addAction=\addToHead | 
				^super.new(key, defName ?? { key.asSymbol }, args, target, addAction);

		
	}
	init { | what, args, target, addAction ... moreArgs | }
***** Interface for UniqueBuffer: Class methods, synonyms, utilities
****** Methods modeled after Buffer class methods

 	MODIFIED, works like Buffer:alloc
	*new { | key, server, numFrames, numChannels, action | }
		like Buffer:alloc, with action executed as soon as info is received, no bufnum
		allocates immediately, boots buffer if needed

	*read { | key, server, path, startFrame = 0, numFrames = -1, action | }
		read from file. Boot buffer if needed. Store in library at [buffers, server:key]

	NOT USED:
	*alloc( | key, server, numFrames, numChannels, completionMessage, bufnum | )
		allocate immediately. Boot server if needed. 
	
****** Methods for convenient use

	*play { | func, args | }
		play last selected buffer or default buffer if none selected
	
	*load { | func, args | }
		load with file open dialog window, play if func is given
	
	*select { | func, args | }
		open list of buffers, select one and execute func if provided.
		selected buffer stays for next calls of "play" or spectrogram. 
	
	*spectrogram { | func, args | }

	*clear { | server | }
		clear all UniqueBuffers on server

****** Synonyms of convenient methods on Buffer class

	*play { | func, args | }
		play last selected buffer or default buffer if none selected
	
	*load { | func, args | }
		load from file and play if given func
	
	*select { | func, args | }
	
	*spectrogram { | func, args | }

	*clear { | server | }
		clear all UniqueBuffers on server

****** UniqueBuffer access methods for String and symbol

String:ubuf(func) -> get / load the UniqueBuffer corresponding to this path, on the default server
	if func is provided, it is used to play the buffer

Symbol:ubuf(func) -> get the UniqueBuffer registered at the default buffer under this string
	if func is provided, it is used to play the buffer

****** Designing the code: argument massage

	*new { | key, server, numFrames, numChannels, bufnum |
		^super.new(key, defName ?? { key.asSymbol }, args, target, addAction);
	}

	*alloc {
	
	}

     :END:

***** ServerPrep

- Obviate the need to boot the server when starting synths
- Ensure that Buffers and SynthDefs are allocated / sent to the server
  before starting synths, efficiently. 
- Provide a safe way for starting synth and routine processes when the server boots
  or when the tree is inited, ensuring that SynthDefs and Buffers will be loaded first
  
Classes involved: 

- ServerPrep
- ServerActionLoader
- SynthLoader
- DefLoader
- BufLoader
- RoutineLoader
- UniqueBuffer
- Udef

***** UniqueSynth

- Simplify the creation and control of Synths by storing them in a dictionary
  for later access, and by providing utility methods for controlling the duration
  and release time, for synchronizing the execution and life time of routines 
  pertaining to a synth, and for attaching other objects that react to the 
  start and end of a synth. 

Example of how UniqueSynth can simplify the code required: 

Without Symbol:mplay 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(
{
	loop {
		{ 	var synth;
			synth = Synth(\default, [\freq, (25..50).choose.midicps]);
		  	0.1.wait;
		  	synth.release(exprand(0.01, 1.0));
		}.fork;
		[0.1, 0.2].choose.wait;
	};
}.fork;
)

#+END_EXAMPLE


Using Symbol:mplay

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

(
{
	loop {
		\default.mplay([\freq, (25..50).choose.midicps]).dur(0.1, exprand(0.01, 1.0));
		[0.1, 0.2].choose.wait;
	};
}.fork;
)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** EventStream, Function:sched and Function:stream

Simplify the creation and access of Streams from Patterns and their use with Routines and Functions scheduled for repeated execution.  

Example: Simplify the above code even further, while enabling  control of dtime (and any other parameters) via patterns:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(
{	// Symbol:stream creates and / or accesses the stream as appropriate: 
	\default.mplay([\freq, \freq.prand((25..50), inf).midicps]).dur(0.1, exprand(0.01, 1.0));
	\duration.stream(Prand([0.1, 0.2], 20)); // play 20 events only
}.stream; 	
)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: symbol.stream(Prand(...)) is equivalent to \symbol.prand(...)

***** Object methods for easy messaging via NotificationCenter

Simplify the connection of objects for sending messages to each other via NotificationCenter. Automate the creation of mutual NotificationCenter registrations to messages, and their removal when an object receives the message objectClosed. 

One beneficial effect of this is that it is no longer needed to check whether an object stored in a variable is nil in order to decide whether to send it a message. One can create messaging interconnections between objects without storing one in a variable of the other, and one can safely send a message to an object before it is created or after it is no longer a valid receiver of that message. 

***** Code

Enable the selection of parts of a SuperCollider document separated by comments followed by :, the movement between such parts, and the execution of those parts through keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, wrap these code parts in a routine so that number.wait messages can be written straight in the code, without wrapping them in { }.fork or Routine({ }). 

Also ensure that the code will run after the default server is booted and the Buffers and SynthDefs defined as Udefs in a Session have been loaded. 

Shortcuts provided are: 

Command-shift-x: Evaluate the code in an AppClock routine, after booting the default server if needed
Command-shift-alt-x: Evaluate the code in a SystemClock routine, after booting the default server if needed
Command-shift-v: Evaluate and post the results of the code, without routine or server booting
Command-shift-j: Select the next code part
Command-shift-k: Select the previous code part

***** Panes

Arrange Document windows on the screen conveniently for maximum view area on the screen. Provide 2 layouts: single pane and 2 panes side by side, with keyboard shortcuts for switching between them. Provide an auto-updating document list palette for selecting documents by mouse or by string search. Provide a way for switching between a dark colored document theme and the default document theme via keyboard shortcuts, with automatic updating of the coloring of all relevant documents. 

***** Dock

Provide some useful shortcuts for common tasks: 
	browseUserClasses : 	Open a list of all classes defined in the user's Application Support 
		directory. Typing return on a selected item opens the code file with the definition of this class. 

	insertClassHelpTemplate : Insert a template for documenting a class named after the name of the
		document. Inserts listings of superclasses, class and instance variables and methods. 

	openCreateHelpFile : Open a help file for a selected user class. Automatic creation of the file 
			is reserved to code residing outside the distribution files of this library. 

	showDocListWindow :  An auto-updating window listing all open Documents, with selection by mouse click
					or by text search.

	closeDocListWindow : Close the document list window


***** Spectrograph

An example application showing some of the features of this library. Creates a window showing a live running spectrogram of one of the audio channels. The fft polling process for the spectrogram is persistent, that is, it starts as soon as the server boots and re-starts if the server's processes are killed by Command-. It (optionally) stops when the Spectrograph window is closed.
