    Community collection of plugins for SuperCollider 3
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/sc3-plugins/
  -------------------------------------------------------


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

  These plugins should work with any Mac running OSX 10.4 or later. For builds 
  for other systems (10.3, Linux, Windows) or for source code, see the website.
  
  Of course, you'll need SuperCollider 3 in order to use these plugins.
  

HOW TO INSTALL:

  On Mac, copy/move this whole folder-full of stuff to the location
  
          /Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions

  (This installs them for all users. Alternatively you can install them in 
  a similar place in a single user's Library folder.)
